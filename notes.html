    <a href=#content class="skip link"><h3>Skip this content</h3></a>
    Wrinting something <br>Trying to know how skip links work<br>Let's see whether I can skip this paragraph really in my html page<br>
    So u r still reading this it means u haven't skipped to main content or it's not working.If it's not working the possible reason may be
    not using the tags correctly. Another reason could be it was skipped but there was not much content in the paragraph so that we can see 
    the demonstration of the option.<br>Thus I am trying to write few more shit in the lines so that it works correctly.
    <br>Better skip this part - Atleast manually :)<br>
    <strong>Finally worked with skip link option </strong></p>
    <br>
     
    <main id= "content"><h4>U will reach here after u skipped the content.</h4></main>
    <p>What if I can add some lines here also to know how it's working.<br>
    Sorry if u were really skipping those lines. U have to see similar kind of shit here too
    to know whether that's working or not.<br>
    Better let's talk about something better than this. What about my typing speed?<br>
    Now I am writing all these lines fastly because of 10 finger typing. It's helping me alot.
    It is very good skill to practice.
    <br> I forgot to tell one thing - After this works, I am going to cut paste this shit in my notes.html file so that i can read there :>) </p>
